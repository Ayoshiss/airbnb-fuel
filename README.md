# airbnb-dapp

First create the contracts needed for the all the functionalities, then create and setup a fuel wallet. 

After that deploy the contract to fuel blockchain, setup IPFS with to upload images before deploying the contract. I used pinata -> http://pinata.cloud/ 

And finally setup frontend by running " git clone https://github.com/0xmetaschool/fuel-airbnb-frontend-boilerplate.git " 

After cloning, run npm install and then run npx fuels build to add contracts to frontend. 

Finally run the project with npm start and bam! you're first fuel based airbnb is ready
